# twitter_player_performance
Personal project done by Moez Dbira in order to put into practice some Data Engineering/Data Science skills learnt

## What the project about ? 
Having a list of football Teams and players, the project aims to study the correlation between a player's performance and a the sentiment of tweets about him.

## How we do it ? 
On one hand, we daily retrieve tweets data and analyse their sentiment i.e we give a score for every tweet about a player depending on if the tweet is negative or positive.
On the other hand, we collect the players rating after every game they play.
At the end we visualise the data on a Tableau dashboard
